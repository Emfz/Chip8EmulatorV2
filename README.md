This is a Chip 8 emulator created with Python. It was built using the pygame, pytest, keyboard and numpy modules.

You can download the Windows executable from [this google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qaZ39bMFhur_-Ll7Br1VbN2jGE-RfBHu?usp=sharing).
To use it, just download your favorite rom from the web, rename it to "rom.ch8" and place it in the same folder as the executable.

Otherwise, you can clone this repository, install `requirements.txt` and run `main.py`.

The keybindings are:

4 5 6 D -> q w e r <br>
7 8 9 E -> a s d f <br>
